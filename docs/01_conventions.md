## Gradients of vector fields

The gradient of a vector field $\phi$ with

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi:\mathbb R^n &\to \mathbb R^n\\
x&\mapsto \phi(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

is defined as 

$$
\nabla \phi = \mathbf A = [a_{ij}],\text{ with }a_{ij} = \frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial x_j}.
$$

!!! note
    Some sources define the gradient of a vector field with $\partial\phi_j/\partial x_i$ for the $ij$-th component of the matrix.
